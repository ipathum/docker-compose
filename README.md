**Hey, there!**

**I’m Isuru Pathum, and I’m very happy about creating educational tech content.**

This Repository **docker-files** is my personal docker compose collection. Here you'll find docker-compose.yml templates.

I created them as free resources to be used in your specific use cases. If you're searching for detailed, in-depth tutorials on some tools or technologies, check out my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@isoftp).
